The staff are polite but slow.\n9 - We need more guidance in the next steps provided by your service. The staff was busy and could not help much\n10 - Organized lots of social distancing. awesome staff security was there.\n11 - This location lives up to my expectation for service bc\n12 - Their app is poorly developed and staff are doing nothing to fix it. Until they do everyone will just have to do rounds to the location again and again for verification.\n13 - The service provided are expensive. Staff was unhelpful\n14 - Staff clearly explained the steps I should take to change my legal name and thoughtfully instructed me how to get to Commissionaire BC taking electronic fingerprints first. After that was done, I went back to the center and he checked my new BC MSP number and helped me completing my application\n15 - Staff are great! The line up out the door and around the corner was ridiculous for this service!\n16 - Drop in location & found that it is closed on Saturdays. Looks like I've to visit from Mon-Fri. and it's open from 8:30 a.m. onwards. No loss since Starbucks & Bigwheel Burger is just down the corner or across is Yoshi Sushi for an early lunch that offers discount of 20% off on weekends\n17 - It is better to go to a location other than this. It is because I wasn't sure and spent the $3 parking where it's free somewhere else.\n18 - Very knowledgable and polite staff. Yet the wait time for service is riduculous.\n19 - long waiting for the service\n20 - As always the staff was very helpful and informative and I could've swore I saw a smile under that mask\n21 - Fast easy replacement of my driver's license.  Made appointment,  was seen promptly and the staff was cheerful and efficient.  Overall 5-10 minutes!Very pleased customer!!\n22 - Everyone was attentive to the line of people and greeted each person with a smile. A quick and painless experience at this location.\n23 - The service is fine. But it would be cool if you were open on weekends when people are actually available so you donâ€™t have to take time off work\n24 - Always happy & has a great experience with staff there! Very friendly & very helpful\n25 - Had issues concerning stolen ID.Very helpful staff .Very experienced 5/5 for me for service.\n26 - We had an appointment found parking quickly and had great service.\n27 - Terrible experience with the customer service reps\n28 - Helped me to renew my service card quickly and professionally, and were user-friendly as well as being pleasant to deal with. I asked for directions for my next stop and staff provided a hand-drawn map! Above and beyond. Thanks folks.\n29 - Best service and lovely people\n30 - I visited twice Service BC Maple ridge and both of the time I had wonderful service experience with them. Especially staff named DIANA was very very polite,helpful,friendly above and beyond resolving my Driving licence related issues\n31 - Just been here to get my BC services card and Driving licence renewed. perfect example of how to operate service during a pandemic. Swift, efficient, professional and courteous staff. Well done!\n32 - Worst experience at this location. Staff was failing to do basic things for my purpose.\n33 - It was an excellent experience for me when I went there for my son's first name change. Staff was so helpful and giving me all the instructions with patience\n34 - location is well layed out. Had no trouble finding where I needed to go for my license application.\n35 - Very organised during these times. The staff that helped me was very courteous and friendly.\n36 - One of a staff attitude was awful\n37 - Very helpful staff. Thank you very much for the service.\n38 - Everyone observing social distancing, unfortunately not enough people using face masks. But service was fast and smooth. Thanks.\n39 - The service was quick & extremely safe as far as Covid-19 is concerned\n40 - It would be helpful in these times, if they would list that their current hours are for seniors with an appt from 9am - 10:30am , and then the general public starting at 10:30am . And it would be much more appreciated if when arriving upon Service Canada's door that we were informed in a polite manner. Why have people become so rude?\n41 - Very hard to find, they should have better signage. Friendly staff and easy to fill out forms.\n42 - The location is marked wrong. The gov website says its 250 - 455 Columbia Street, when its actually just 455 Columbia street. idk if I just dont know how street adresses work or if this is a typo more-less. Google maps is showing us some random house. The kamloops courthouse people!! Please fix this issue BC government\n43 - Friendly and professional staff. Was a bit hard to find the location.\n44 - I had a great experience although I am very patient and I had to get my business complete. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.\n45 - Wrong location\n46 - Excellent staff! thank you!\n47 - They had marking on the floor so that everyone knew where to go and stand. The line progressed very fast and the lady that helped me was knowledgeable and polite.\n48 - Customer service here is great very helpful people work here\n49 - Very pleased with the service I received this morning. Every staff who dealt with me was very friendly and helpful - couldn't ask for better.\n50 - They haven't updated there hours on the internet and when you tell them that they lie to you and tell you they have. Zero respect for people's time\n51 - Awesome service...Deven in the Duncan branch...he was so very helpful and very patient with me...thank you\n52 - Outstanding service! Prompt friendly, and very helpful staff!\n53 - Have had good experiences each time I have been here. Staff have been friendly and helpful, and the lineups have always been short. Keep up the great work!\n54 - Surprised by all the negativity as my experience was excellent. I had to go there twice, and both times I was greeted with courtesy and a smile. Very helpful, listened to everything I had to say (my situation was complicated) and gave me excellent advice. Maybe the locals here aren't used to dealing with these kinds of places in major cities, where hours of wait time & grumpy people 'helping' you are the norm!\n55 - The drivers liscencing center is great! I took both my new drivers road test and my full liscence road test through them. I found them to be fair and informative. I highly recommend getting liscenced through them. Nicole is the best road test examiner!\n56 - Staff exceptionally helpful today!\n57 - Very good service!\n58 - Went to renew my driver's licence.The wait time, under the current circumstances, was not too long.Total time was approx 35 mins. Staff was courteous and efficient. Knew her stuff & took less than 5 minutes.Excellent service!\n59 - The line was long but moved quickly. The agent was fast and friendly. I am satisfied \n60 - don't listen to the reviewer who said Sue was a bad examiner. I had Sue as my examiner for my motorcycle road test and she was awesome. Very easy-going and kind. The test went smoothly and I passed. The person who left that 1-star review probably needed more practice.\n61 - I am certain that everyone will be happy when all of the rules for COVID-19 are no longer needed. The staff there are doing an amazing job following the protocol but it definitely losses the \"personal side\" of everything.\n62 - Had to renew my license. I waited in line outside with about 5 people ahead of me. I was in and out in 15 minutes.Easily the worst service centre I've ever been to and I've lived in Ontario...So that's saying something. Nothing more than some paper shufflers staff who are afraid to do any work to help. If you can go to other location, you should.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"63 - Easily the worst service centre I've ever been to and I've lived in Ontario...So that's saying something.

Could use more chairs for those waiting, though.\n67 - Great fast service\n68 - One driving instructor named Lauren, hes a trash examiner and does not deserve his job . Also is considered by a quite a lot of people to be very judgemental about your car, driving, way you look ect. If you see a medium sized, bald guy walk out ...RESCHEDULE\n69 - Quick and efficient service. Went to this office for my Id verification and the clerk was very nice.\n70 - They need to get with the times and either stay open longer or be open on the weekends. The service should be offered for a longer duration.\n71 - got a lecture about reading the website and how I should have done my homework before visiting. Just send me on my way and get over yourself, people don't want a lecture\n72 - Apparently \"not\" set up for payments, so for you to pay something you have to give your number to the clerk, than an unknown number will call you and you have to give them your credit card info (security code included)! And this is supposed to be government office? Joke\n73 - It's closed early always even the elevator is not available to there during off time. Difficult to find a parking lot. The location should open for longer hours for providing service.\n74 - Tucked away in the building - hours are stupid but the staff were very friendly and helped with any question\n75 - unhelpful staff with no knowledgeable.\n76 - Should be called terrible service BC. One particular lady has been super rude to my wife and I twice now for no apparent reason. This person has no business serving anyone. It makes it very difficult to get your stuff done at this location.\n77 - Helpful & friendly staff.\n78 - never helped me when i needed stuff and service canada is in 1 day of the month bad\n79 - They were so rude when I went in, wouldn't accept a Canadian passport as valid ID or AB driver's license. Frustrating experience with staff and service provided.\n80 - Should be open on the weekends for people who work an actual job or at least have a phone service open. To lend a hand to those who need it after working 7am to 5 PM. Government tax crooks\n81 - Informative staff\n82 - Fast and easy service. Short wait. Small sign outside made it difficult to find\n83 - Helpful staff but no advocate to help.\n84 - very understanding and quick to help staff at the location.\n85 - Best ServiceBC location\n86 - Great place to get your things done in a timely manner and information in case they can not help you.\n87 - Staff are doing an awesome job of accomodating everyone in a timely manner as well as maintaining good social distancing measures!\n88 - Very good service quick extremely helpful. Rosetta is very good\n89 - My spouse and I had terrific service due to prompt calls backs from their staff, and a very helpful and efficient staff member working through details due to an out-of-province move. The Prince George office made new move paperwork very easy, and helped explain a great many things very well\n90 - Booked an appointment for service online. Arrived at the prescribed time. In and out in 5 min.\n91 - I was very pleased with the service at office. I had an appointment at 11:30, I arrived fifteen minutes early and was finished by 11:24, 6 minutes early\n92 - Only had to pay a ticket for service. Staff was friendly & service was very fast!\n93 - Staff gave me all info I needed and the line moved fast\n94 - Polite staff. Well organised service as expected\n95 - Always quick service. Staff have done a great job on physical distancing requirements\n96 - Canâ€™t complete anything online without there being an issue. Pretty horrible online service. As if I want to bring my five month old and wait for two hours to ask a question to staff here.\n97 - not very informative, the staff just wanted me to go away\n98 - Quick and simple even with covid on the go\n99 - If you are looking to get hunting tickets or renew your resident licence don't bother coming here and spending the 3$ for two hours of parking. It is listed on the gov.bc site as a place to renew the service but you cannot. If you go to a services canada and they tell you to come here don't listen to them.\")\n100 - You cannot make payment for services here!!! Waste of time... went to make ambulance service payment and clerks cannot accept payment... why bother with this office !\n101 - It's very hard to find location. I had to go to a different place because I wasn't sure and spent the $3 parking where it's free somewhere else.\n102 - This location lives up to my expectation for service bc.\n103 - The reception desk staff (I noticed his name tag \"Richard\") was very helpful.\n104 - The person with whom I spoke was oblivious to my concern. She could neither answer my questions nor direct me to someone who could help me resolve my difficulty. All of my picture identification has been lost/stolen. I'm told that in order to get picture ID, I require picture ID. Now, if I had picture ID, I'd hardly need to request aid in attaining a replacement, would I? The person I spoke to was courteous (to a point) but was as useful as a potato in this regard. This circular waste of time is costly to both me and Provincial Services. Get real. This is a Beaureucratic stupidity that needs to be resolved immediately. I can stand in a queue for an hour at BC Services, speak to an agent that I've known for years, have them pull up my previous picture IDs on their computer, see my face and my signature, my tenancy agreement, my mail etc. and still be told that the agent can't help me? I then have to spend my time in another queue, be kept on hold on the phone if I can't linger in their office like a bad smell or have to write this to make a simple point? The point being \"Give me the picture of me that is MY ID\". Outrageous! What are you paid for? Platitudes? This is ridiculous. I've lived here for 40 years and a kid has easier access to photo ID. It is non-sensical. With all due respect... Robert Stephen Dugdale.\n105 - Awesome Staff\n106 - Always a perfect experience in service bc. location is easily reachable.\n107 - Easy peasy customer service.\n108 - Welcoming and very professional staff. Like all in one service for ICBC driver services and Service BC.\n109 - i think staff do a good job!! :)\n110 - so bad staff\n111 - Excellent and fast service. The location is very convenient and beautiful\n112 - Was as great as it can be, very kind and understanding staff\n113 - Best to make an appointment else you may wait in line for up to 2 hours with covid protocols in place limiting the number of people inside. Metered parking in the area. Be sure to plug the parking meter for a while if you decide to wing it with out an appt else you may end up with a parking ticket to top of your day. Friendly staff. It's not the staff that are slow is just the slow process of the system/technology/business process.\n114 - Do not suggest this location for your road test. I drive a 2021 Mazda CX-5 that will beep at you if you come within 1 foot of another vehicle, and the tester literally jumped and screamed in the passenger seat while I was driving at a normal speed, in my lane, past a parked car more than 3 feet away from the car while my car did not make a sound. It seemed as staff did not have something right in his head as he would not leave my vehicle long after the test was finished and we had finished talking and it was extremely uncomfortable.\n115 - Wait on line Outdoors was about one hour, waiting on a chair indoors about twenty minutes. Service was about as quick as normal. Staff seems to be dealing with these restrictions quite well with the exception of the front desk who seems rather short-tempered. And rightly so as people keep bypassing the line and just walking into the building and she must constantly tell them to go back into line. Once inside, social distancing is taken to the extreme and cleanliness is over the top. This is probably the safest space in the whole City.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"116 - My experience with Service BC in Vernon has been outstanding. They helped me register my well which was complicated and time-consuming. Rather than make me try and deal with that on a glitchy web page, I was given the option of coming into the office and have someone help me through it. Saved me a lot of stress! They were also extremely helpful when I made application to put a foot bridge across the creek on my property.\n117 - Friendly and helpful staff. Definitely recommend making an appointment if you're short on time. I managed to be in and out for a drivers license renewal in about fifteen minutes.\n118 - Tried booking an appointment through phonecall, but the number was incorrect on their website. Tried to book an appointment online through their website, and was told that I had to book it in person. Waited in line for an hour, only to be told that I had to call in. If they're so uptight about what appointments need to occur online or in person, maybe put the correct information on their website to begin with instead of wasting everybody's time.\n119 - VERY rude staff here. Would recommend the drive into another location Kelowano to avoid this office at all costs!\n120 - Was as great as it can be, very kind and understanding staff\n121 - The staff is very friendly. It's hard to get in there thanks to Covid restrictions, but once you're in, the service is great!!\n122 - Anytime there is a wait I lose a star. The servicebc staff however is superb some friendly some just don't care if you are there. drivers licenses plus other services are available.\n123 - It was perfect service.I get what I needed. Thanks to awesome staff.\n124 - Worst place to do your business,very rude staff,very unhelpful full. Recommend going to another location of  service bc.\n125 - Friendliest staff I've seen so far.\n126 - customer service was fantastic. I called and left voice message, Tori returned my call within 4 minutes of my hanging up the phone...WOW\n127 - Need more staff or to make it so you can do stuff online instead of going into the actual service center.\n128 - Whenever I have to go to Service BC it's been pleasant, apart from the waiting time. The Staff was always very polite and friendly.\n129 - Super friendly and helpful staff, every time i have been to Service BC in Vernon, they have been brilliant!\n130 - Mostly a good experience to get the service I wanted.\n131 - the staff at Service BC were extremely helpful and pleasant. The location is very convenient\n132 - I had an awesome , quick and courteous experience with staff. Came back and had even better customer service.\n133 - I have always had great service from this office.\n134 - This place is horrible, every time I go, itâ€™s an awful experience. Staff needs to be taught how to deal with customers in a pleasant way, but of course, you have no choice but to deal with them\n135 - If I could rate this office less than one star, I would. The staff was completely unhelpful and extremely rude. We were treated as an inconvenience. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this place to anyone, worst experience with a Service BC Iâ€™ve ever had.\n136 - No one should operate customer service this way.\n137 - Great place.Was very busy but staff was friendly and helpful.\n138 - Renewed my licences there a few months ago. Staff were nice, courteous.\n139 - Once you go into location its not to bad. But don't even try to call them for service.\n140 - Very good service\n141 - Quick and friendly staff.\n142 - They NEVER answer the phone. No service from a service center....Also been waiting for a driver's license for over a month\n143 - Should be called Non-Service B.C. No service at all and pathetic staff.\n144 - Service in the name is misleading.NOBODY answers must be the NEW level of non service.\n145 - Never had a problem with service offered by the staff.\n146 - Excellent location and awesome staff.\n147 - The place is located near lot of restaurants. Excellent staff too.\n148 - The staff help me and my child in name changing application.\n149 - After the excellent service. We had good food from restaurants near the location.\n150 - Clerk Curtis was rude and snooty. I popped over on my lunch break to drop off some documents and was told they only do limited services. OK, no problem -- tell me where to go. Instead, I got a lecture about reading the website and how I should have done my homework before visiting. Just send me on my way and get over yourself, people don't want a lecture.\n151 - Had a great customer service experience.\n152 - The staff eased the process of new business license renewal for our company. Excellent service\n153 - Quick and fast service. Location is near an aquarium if you have some free time.\n154 - friendly service by staff.\n155 - Excellent location with parking facility. friendly service.\n156 - The museum that is here is absolutely fantastic. The staff know the history of Stewart in and out. The tour starts off with a video on the history of location. Then you can explore the rest of the museum (about 4 rooms) of interesting memorabilia and historical pieces. Each of which the staff are happy to explain the significances of. I would definitely recommend this museum to anyone travelling into Stewart. Itâ€™s a great way to gather some serious appreciation for such a small wonderful community with such an interesting history that is still in the making.\n157 - The location is near a museum. The service was processesed quickly by the staff.\n158 - Our new business license application took a lot of time due to rude behaviour by staff. The location is awesome.\n159 - Staff was slow. The place is one of the few attractions in this location.\n160 - Not great service, and gave misinformation... also, they always seem to have some judgemental comments about whatever it is youâ€™re there to deal with.\n161 - Very helpful service. They need more staff for the population of the Squamish though.\n162 - good service. staff know their stuff\n163 - Excellent customer service by the staff on providing what we need\n164 - Pathetic service. Location is not accessible and doesn't have parking facility.\n165 - One star for service offered.\n166 - Interesting going in as there was staff to meet me and direct me to where I wanted to go. Everyone was kind and respectful with proper social distancing for service.\n167 - customer service was found to be above and beyond the normal. Was treated kindly and respectfully by this staff. It was much appreciated at a difficult time. Thank you ladies!\n168 - Hours are different then what's posted online. Excellent staff\n169 - Used to wait at least 20 minutes in other Service BC Centre, mainly Vancouver, so was pleasantly surprised to be in and out within 15min with great client service.\n170 - Location is excellent. Yet some staff are rude.\n171 - Fast and quick customer service with less waiting time. Thanks to awesome staff.\n172 - location is difficult to acess with public transporation. A staff named John smith in tag was rude with me.\n173 - Friendliest staff I have met in my life. This is my first review. location is quite difficult to acess.\n174 - Fast and easy customer service. Friendliest staff I have ever met.\n175 - Extremely friendly customer service. I went a there with countless questions and staff helped me with a smile on their faces.Super happy with their Services.I highly recommend this location to anyone on the Sunshine Coast\n176 - Wow. Most of the BC service can be accessed at the location formally known as The Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. It occured to me that there was more than enough office space here for all BC Services for some time.\n177 - The location is very convenient and accesible. Friendly staff\n178 - Very friendly staff. In and out in ten minutes. Service is very efficent too. Make an appointment now!\n179 - Very friendly staff and I had hardly any wait time. Regarding the road test, the lady who critiqued me was excellent. All instructions were clear and understandable, and after the road test, the advise and feedback was very constructive. The instructor who gives the road test is not there to fail you, but to make sure that you are driving safely. Given the terrible driving habits of some people out there, I'm all for ICBC setting a high bar for passing the road test.\n","name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":"180 - Worst place to give a road test, very very rude staff, waste of time and money.. very small mistakes never going back to that location. wasted so much time waiting for slot end result is a fail.\n181 - Very friendly staff, but holy God your wait times are wild. Especially the hoops you have to jump through just to clear an order through the government, gosh. I've also heard things all around town about the lady who does the driving tests here, even though I met her and she seems nice. Go to location which are more easier and less wild than horrible place.\n182 - Very quick and friendly service\n183 - The staff who helped me was very rude and condescending. She talked over me and didnâ€™t let me finish asking my question - completely interrupted me. I had a few questions for her as Iâ€™ve just moved into province and bought my first car ever. Because I didnâ€™t have the correct documents (I didnâ€™t know what I needed) she instantly turned me away and didnâ€™t want me wasting her time.Not good customer service.\n184 - Need to improve the customer service. But not all the staff some really need to learn what's customer service means.\n185 - One of staff named Jade in tag was the best! Very helpful, very patient!\n186 - Awesome service. The police guards staff at the front need to smile more but other than that they're great\n187 - Follow social distancing guidelines well. Safe location to be at.\n188 - Very friendly prompt service\n189 - Fast help and a lot of good staff working there.\n190 - Was very helpful and attentive to the needs.
