They need to get with the times and either stay open longer or be open on the weekends. Ideally both for all services offered. 
Excellent location and awesome staff. 
Was very helpful and attentive to the needs. Pleased with the service provided by the lady officer in Service BC. 
Have had good experiences each time I have been here. Staff have been friendly and helpful, and the lineups have always been short. Keep up the great work! 
If you are looking to get hunting tickets or renew your resident licence don't bother coming here and spending the 3$ for two hours of parking.  It is listed on the gov. bc site as a place to renew the service but you cannot.  If you go to a services canada and they tell you to come here don't listen to them. ") 
great service from government and excellent staff. location could be better. 
Need to improve the customer service. But not all the staff some really need to learn what's customer service means. 
Don't listen to the reviewer who said Sue was a bad examiner. I had Sue as my examiner for my motorcycle road test and she was awesome. Very easy-going and kind. The test went smoothly and I passed. The person who left that 1-star review probably needed more practice. 
The line was long but moved quickly. The agent was fast and friendly. I am satisfied 
Best ServiceBC location 
Staff gave me all info I needed and the line moved fast 
i think staff do a good job!! :) 
Apparently "not" set up for payments, so for you to pay something you have to give your number to the clerk, than an unknown number will call you and you have to give them your credit card info (security code included)! And this is supposed to be government office? Joke 
Tucked away in the building - hours are stupid but the staff were very friendly and helped with any question 
If I could rate this office less than one star, I would. The staff was completely unhelpful and extremely rude. We were treated as an inconvenience. I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone, worst experience with a Service BC I’ve ever had. 
Interesting going in as there was staff to meet me and direct me to where I wanted to go. Everyone was kind and respectful with proper social distancing for service. 
great service from government and excellent staff. location could be better 
Very knowledgable and polite staff. Yet the wait time for service is riduculous. 
Worst place to give a road test,  very very rude staff,  waste of time and money. .  very small mistakes never going back to that location.  wasted so much time waiting for slot end result is a fail.  
It was perfect service. I get what I needed.  Thanks to awesome staff.  
Service is pretty quick and decent. Pleasant staff to deal with as well 
Very helpful service. They need more staff for the population of the Squamish though. 
Should be called terrible service BC. One particular lady has been super rude to my wife and I twice now for no apparent reason. This person has no business serving anyone. It makes it very difficult to get your stuff done at this location. 
very understanding and quick to help staff at the location. 
Mostly a good experience to get the service I wanted. 
Was as great as it can be, very kind and understanding staff 
Once you go into location its not to bad. But don't even try to call them for service. 
The staff eased the process of new business license renewal for our company. Excellent service 
Hours are different then what's posted online. Excellent staff 
Everyone observing social distancing, unfortunately not enough people using face masks. But service was fast and smooth. Thanks. 
Wrong location 
Worst experience at this location. Staff was failing to do basic things for my purpose. 
Whenever I have to go to Service BC it's been pleasant, apart from the waiting time. The Staff was always very polite and friendly. 
Service in the name is misleading. NOBODY answers must be the NEW level of non service.  
Anytime there is a wait I lose a star. The servicebc staff however is superb some friendly some just don't care if you are there. drivers licenses plus other services are available. 
My experience with Service BC in Vernon has been outstanding. They helped me register my well which was complicated and time-consuming. Rather than make me try and deal with that on a glitchy web page, I was given the option of coming into the office and have someone help me through it. Saved me a lot of stress! They were also extremely helpful when I made application to put a foot bridge across the creek on my property. 
Easy peasy customer service. 
Fast and friendly service. Great covid plan 
We had an appointment found parking quickly and had great service. 
Had issues concerning stolen ID. Very helpful staff . Very experienced 5/5 for me for service.  
The location is very accessible and pleasant. Service is quick and decent.
